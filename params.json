Our goal is to help developers that don't want to spend time configuring their own computer to spend time doing what they want.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n  With the power of our community, we take the already awesome [fish shell][fish] to another level by creating simple-to-use plugins and themes.\r\n\r\n[fish]: http://fishshell.com/\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n  A user-friendly framework for managing your fish-shell configuration. Includes optional plugins (brew, git, rails, python, node, etc) and themes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOh-my-fish is built for recent versions of the fish shell, namely \"fish 2.0\".\r\n\r\n    curl -L https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh\r\n\r\nIf you want to install it manually, keep reading.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nEnabling a new plugin or theme is as easy as it should be. Open your fish configuration file\r\n`~/.config/fish/config.fish` and specify the theme and the plugins you want to use.\r\n\r\nAs an example, enabling rails and git plugins is as easy as adding this line `set fish_plugins git rails` \r\nto your configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nIf you have many functions which go well together, you can create custom plugin in the `custom/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME`\r\ndirectory and add to it as many functions as you want.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with oh-my-fish,\r\ncreate a plugin of the same name in the `custom/plugins/` directory and it will be loaded\r\ninstead of the one shipped with oh-my-fish.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to override any of the default behavior or add some environment variables,\r\njust add a new file (ending in .load) into the `custom/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Send us your theme!\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to collect a bunch of themes for our command prompts. You can see existing ones in the `themes/` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Switching to fish\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following command:\r\n\r\n    grep -q '^/usr/local/bin/fish$' /etc/shells; or echo '/usr/local/bin/fish' | sudo tee -a /etc/shells\r\n    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish\r\n\r\nchsh will prompt you for your password, and change your default shell.\r\n\r\nTo switch your default shell back, you can run:\r\n\r\n    chsh -s /bin/bash\r\n\r\nSubstitute /bin/bash with /bin/tcsh or /bin/zsh as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Manual installation\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n```\r\n    git clone git://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish.git ~/.oh-my-fish\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a new fish config by copying the fish template we've provided.\r\n```\r\n    cp ~/.oh-my-fish/templates/config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Start / restart fish (just open a new terminal)\r\n\r\n\r\n###.
